# GitHub Pages

This folder is used for the **public link on GitHub**.

1. In your repo go to **Settings** → **Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: **main**, Folder: **/docs**.
4. Save.

Your public link will be:

**https://santirio18-cmyk.github.io/gafesync-cafe-help/**

Note: This is a static landing page. The full app (Need Help button, staff login) needs a server. Run it locally with `npm run dev` or deploy to Vercel for a live link.
